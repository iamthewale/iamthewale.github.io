Scott Snyder's writing career revolves around horror stories. Starting with [*American Vampire*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/American_Vampire), a tale about the lives of the titular American vampires shown at the backdrop of the history of USA, up until [*Death of the Family*](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_the_Family), a recently published *Batman* story featuring the even-gorier-than-before Joker, he has explored the whole wide range of humanity's primal fears. Maybe because of this, the announcement of *The Wake*, an ocean-based horror miniseries written by Snyder and drawn by Scott Murphy, was not surprising. Yet, what differentiates this horror title from other penned by Snyder is its grand scale. The main story of the discovery of dangerous creatures inhabiting ocean depths is only one element in book's narrative, which breaks the chronological order to present the origins, uncovering, and catastrophic consequences of this terrible finding. By doing so, Snyder presents not one, but two different faces of fear, different in their scope yet unified by the fascination that characterises human reactions when faced with them. He moves from the dread of confronting the Freudian unconscious to Lovecraftian cosmic awe, 'an apprehension of the unknown charged with wonder'[^2].

## Unconscious fear - unknown, yet familiar

Fear distinguishing the very discovery of the "Mermaid" is, at  first glance, merely a recreation of the sense of anguish known from movies like Ridley Scott's *Alien* or John Carpenter's *The Thing*. The basic premise of the plot is identical - a group of characters is confronted with a murderous alien creature in an extremely isolated place. Therefore, the factor differentiating *The Wake* from a multitude of other horror stories must lay in more general concepts -  namely the nature of the monster and its interaction with human beings.

As the story presents in the first issue, the very goal of Dr. Archer's mission is surrounded with a veil of mystery. Fragmentary pretexts under which different scientists were brought together by the shady Agent Cruz uncover the illusory nature of the fettered monster. As a "relic" to be analysed, source of "tissue" and "voice" to be examined, the creature exists on the fringes of human knowledge. The fear evoked by its frightening appearance is therefore transformed into one of the unknown. Despite human attempts to push it into the realm of science and, by doing so, kill its unfamiliarity, fear seems to prevail in every direct confrontation. This concept is made literal by restricting the free-flowing pencils and inks of Sean Murphy by the strict order of Snyder's narrative.

The story of the professor of folklore and mythology, Dr Marin, bleeds out of the page borders as if trying to set itself free from the rigid panel structure. Interestingly, Murphy spreads his drawings in this manner only while picturing the folklore tales, stories existing on the border between truth and fiction. They are captured in the panel structure again as soon as the narrative moves from the timeless legends to more immediate event, the direct encounter with the creature. Because of this juxtaposition, readers can see how the dreamy and merely reality-inspired knowledge  does not neutralise the perilousness but only distracts people from actively opposing it. To go a little bit further, one can reach for Lacan's "Other", a term designating 'radical alterity, an other-ness which transcends the illusory otherness of the imaginary because it cannot be assimilated through identification'[^3]. Even though the famous French psychoanalyst does not equate "Other" with any existing physical representation, I would argue that that's exactly what *The Wake* as a work of fiction does. Folk stories are presented as the attempts to capture the creature, the Other, by inscribing it into the order of the symbolic. Unfortunately, they are invariably futile because of the unknown, maybe even inconceivable nature of the "Mermaid".

Setting of the story contributes to ['showing the unshowable'](http://www.heraldscotland.com/arts-ents/film/david-cronenberg-puts-sigmund-freud-on-the-couch.1328324765 "Alison Rowat, 'David Cronenberg puts Sigmund Freud on the couch'") by literally picturing the well-known visual representation of Freud's psychoanalytical theory - [the iceberg](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Structural-Iceberg.svg "File:Structural-Iceberg.svg - Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia"). When the submarine filled with scientists submerges deeper and deeper in the water, they abandon the realm of conscious, of what's *known*, and enter the field of dangerous unconscious. The character of their encounter with the creature is therefore foreshadowed by the very act of descent into the unknown. It is extremely important, because as such, Snyder openly pictures the creature (and later, the creatures) as the representation of human unconscious, the uncontrollable and hidden part of our psyche. Naturally, this metaphor is also projected upon the appearance of the "Mermaid" itself - fettered hybrid of human and animal, with its toothed mouth gaping in an expression of wild, blind rage.

Its mere concept would have been terrifying, yet Snyder and Murphy produce a fully detailed being, which is even scarier. As the former one said [in an interview](http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=44570 "Snyder & Murphy Tackle The Primal Fear Of The Unknown In &quot;The Wake&quot; - Comic Book Resources"): 'It's also scary how fully realized it is, down to the scales, down to the gills, the way the eyes function'. In contrast to many other horror stories, where the monster's portrayal is deliberately sketchy and, in effect, uncertain, Sean Murphy's drawing focuses on the "realisation" of the creature to leave no room for doubt about its horrifying nature. It is almost inescapable and inevitable in this aspect, what links the story of the "Mermaid" to another element of Snyder's tale - the visions of the ultimate destruction.

## Fascination with the horrifying

Deliberate fragmentation of Snyder's story is another important characteristic of *The Wake*. By shifting between three different time periods - distant past, the present and distant future - he can examine the origin of horror, as represented by confrontations with the creatures, humanity's  final encounter with them and its fatal consequences. First two parts set up a relationship between human beings and the inhuman creatures. As it is revealed in the fourth issue, the discovery of "Mermaid" in the depths of sea is not a discovery at all, because our species have already encountered "them" 100,000 years ago. This deepens the perceived connection between humans and "Mermaids", because it proves "The Aquatic Ape" theory, as presented by Dr Archer in the second issue, and therefore establishes a degree of biological similarity linking us to "them". Furthermore, this relationship is shown in even more animalistic and horrifyingly evolutionary terms when "their" species proves to be more technologically advanced and uses it to brutally exterminate some of our ancestors. As the members of "their" race seem to be even too similar to contemporary human beings, other theory on this mystery seems to be equally possible - that they were *Homo sapiens sapiens* who used the technology of the "Mermaids" to extinguish their competitors, *Homo neanderthalensis*, from the planet Earth. This theory seems to be even more terrifying, because it presents the treachery within the *Homo* genus and establishes a subservient relationship between our ancestors and mysterious, powerful "them".

In all of these examples, one attribute characterises the nature of connection between us and the creatures - fascination. From the banishment of the savage, painting pictures of the "Mermaids" in a cave 100,000 years ago to the contemporary governmental attempts to determine the '**context** for the creature' - fascination and the desire to discover seem to be the leading motives behind those actions. Yet again, the psychoanalytical approach comes helpful, as Freud portrays human psyche as always split between different internal and external mechanisms of control and a deeper realm of desires and behaviours that have to be repressed for us to live in the social world. Therefore, the need to discover and achieve completion with the Other becomes completely understandable, as it may be seen as a necessary step to regain our sense of wholeness and identity. Scientists' various theories determining direct connection between either "them" and "us" (in "The Aquatic Ape" theory) or Other and knowledge (in the raindrop theory) can be seen as such. The source of fascination is, for that reason, embedded in our history and psyche.

This forms an interesting commentary on the nature of horror stories themselves. It can be read that Snyder in *The Wake* attempts not only to present the source of our most primal fear - the confrontation of conscious with unconscious - but also finds the very reason for why horror stories attract us to such degree. By analysing the contradictory character of fear itself, that is the tension between fear and desire for discovery, he exhibits a great skill in fusing the meta-commentary on the genre itself with a cohesive and multi-layered plot.

## Fantasies of the ultimate destruction

![The Wake #1](http://bulkybistro.com.s3.amazonaws.com/article_photos/2013-11-22_The_Wake_1.2.jpg)

Scott Snyder's meta-commentary is also extended upon the popular "End of the World As We Know It" trope. The very first scene opens with the portrayal of the unspecified city, half-drowned after some kind of an aquatic apocalypse. By revealing the end of the story (or, at least its first storyline) to the readers, Snyder makes them curious not only about "What?" but also about "Why?" and "How?". Specific type of horror created as a result of this addition is characterised by the presence of the so-called "cosmic fear", first defined by another writer of horror stories, Howard Phillips Lovecraft. 'When to this sense of fear and evil the inevitable fascination of wonder and curiosity is superadded' he writes, 'there is born a composite of keen emotion and imaginative provocation whose vitality must of necessity endure as long as the human race itself.'[^4] Lovecraft's observation, apart from explaining the effects of "cosmic awe", touches upon the timelessness of the fascination with the unexplainable and absolutely overwhelming. The continuous popularity of "epic" movies picturing the apocalypse-like situations, ever since the CGI effects reached the level of plausibility, serves as a proof for the validity of his remark. Scott Snyder is certainly aware of this seemingly never ending fascination with the ultimate destruction as he puts on display the monumental explosion on the surface of Mars as well as pictures the destruction of the Moon, as seen from Earth. In the process, he manages to both satisfy "the need for thrills" of his audience and, again, form a meta-commentary on the nature of the horror stories, especially the fact, that they always seem to end in destruction, either of human life or the world itself.

It is worth mentioning, that the horror story portrayed in the first four issues of *The Wake* does not represent the complete tale. With 6 more issues to go, Snyder and Murphy may completely change the tone of this miniseries, either by expanding on the themes of different types of horror or by focusing on something else entirely. In fact, during Vertigo's panel at the New York Comic Con, [Scott Snyder has said](http://www.bleedingcool.com/2013/10/15/what-scott-snyder-said-at-nycc-the-wake-is-about-to-change-gears-and-hes-completely-committed-to-american-vampire/ "What Scott Snyder Said at NYCC - The Wake Is About To &#039;Change Gears&#039; and He&#039;s &#039;Completely Committed&#039; to American Vampire - Bleeding Cool Comic Book, Movies and TV News and Rumors") that 'Issue #5 is the big turning point of the series' and 'The second half of the book jumps in time to an almost fairy tale like version of post-apocalyptic America'. Notwithstanding, we can enjoy and appreciate the first four issues of this series as they are - a multilayered tale about the nature, types and effects of horror.
